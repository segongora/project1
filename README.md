# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

- First I have a index.html which is a page where the list of the books is displayed. In this page you can also search for any book with the search box.

- Layout.html is the page I use to have the same code in all .html pages. I use a simple navigation bar from bootstrap, to link all my other pages. I also use it to define if the button access or profile should be displayed.
